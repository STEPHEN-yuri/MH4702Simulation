# MH4702Simulation

Aviation is a vital component of Singapore’s business. We hope to improve passengers’ travel experiences by reducing their waiting time at the immigration counters. We approach this by modeling the airport's immigration counters as a form of the queuing system and therefore optimizing it. 

## Simulation for the case when K=2,3
